# MyCalc
MyCalc application is a simple calculator app that supports basic mathematical operations. It is built for Android devices.
I created this project during my learning phase in Android development, hence, there are chances of the application being buggy or unstable.
The emulator used for running and testing the device is Pixel 2 XL and there is only one layout file created, i.e. for the screen-sizes similar to that of Pixel 2 XL.
The language used for the development of the application is Kotlin.
